# Producer and Consumer problem

In this project, we attempt to tackle the classic producer and consumer problem.

Producer and consumer are seperate processes with a shared memory.

Consumer conducts a multithreaded search.

Producer provides the data to search from.

makefile now included.

'make' to compile

'make run_test' to run with test values

with scripts:

'sh build.sh Zoomreport.txt email 6' to build and execute with 6 threads

'sh removeOldObj.sh' to remove old executables

'sh debug.sh' to compile with debug flags and run gdb on the program
